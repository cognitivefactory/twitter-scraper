## ✏️ Setup

> **Note** This project is currently under development. It is not yet ready for production.

Please install first the required packages with the following command:

```ps1
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Then you should setup a Twitter developer account and create a new app to get your API keys. You can find more information [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api).

Then you should create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following lines (based on [.env.example](.env.example)):

```txt
API_KEY =
API_KEY_SECRET =
BEARER_TOKEN =
```
